# scripts
These scripts are for my own personal use. Use these with caution as I have not written them with systems other than my own in mind

If you want to use them, these are the commands to follow:

Homestead installation script:
'''
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabrielSturtevant/scripts/master/scripts/homestead.sh | bash
'''

JetBrains Toolbox installer:
'''
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabrielSturtevant/scripts/master/scripts/jetbrains-toolbox.sh | sudo bash
'''
